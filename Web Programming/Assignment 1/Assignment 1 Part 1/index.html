    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
    ALOW provides on a non-profit basis accommodation in which charitable or
    non-profit organizations and associations, which meet the admission
    criteria of the Corporation, render services to the needy and the poor of
    the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton and the surrounding areas.

    ALOW empowers people and communities to live with renewed dignity and
    hope. Through our 45,000 square feet of affordable offices and facilities,
    non-profits provide direct services to diverse populations. You will also
    find an active cultural environment, with an 850 seat performance theatre,
    200 seat community hall, and rehearsal rooms. We foster a positive
    environment where tenants, patrons, and community can be productive and
    successful. We are a registered charity whose revenue comes primarily from
    facilities rentals and occasional one time grants.
